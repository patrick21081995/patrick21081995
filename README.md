🔭 I’m currently working on Viskositas (https://github.com/patrick21081995/VISKOSITAS), a deep neural network to predict the viscosity in multicomponent chemical systems, in a GUI (Tkinter) (Beta version) and Tsolidus, with some machine learning models (Decision Tree, Neural Network and Linear Regression) to predict the solidus temperature in typical slags in metallurgical systems.

🌱 I’m currently learning Metallurgical Engineering (Ifes).

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI projects, data analysis, build prediction models, python programming... and more, and more and more!!!!!!
