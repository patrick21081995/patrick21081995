ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on VISKOSITAS, a neural network to predict the viscosity in multicomponent chemical systems, in a GUI (Tkinter) (Beta version) and TSOLIDUS, with some machine learning models (Decision Tree, Neural Network and Linear Regression) to predict the solidus temperature in typical slags in metallurgical systems.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Metallurgical Engineering (Ifes).

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI projects, data analysis, build prediction models, python programming... and more, and more and more!!!!!!
